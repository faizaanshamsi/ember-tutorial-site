      As much as I'd like to make a blog or to-do list, let's make an app that
      lets us build stock portfolios. We'll be able to add/edit/delete these
      portfolios and add/edit/delete stocks that belong to these portfolios.
    </p>
    <p class="flow-text">
      The first thing we'll do is set up our project directory. We'll have a
      single project folder with our Rails and Ember app inside. We'll keep both
      apps under one <code>git</code> repo*. In your terminal
      <code>
        <blockquote>
        <p>mkdir [APPNAME]</p>
        <p>cd [APPNAME]</p>
        <p>git init</p>
      </blockquote>
    </code>

    * A strong case can be made for keeping your API and Ember App under
    seperate version control so they can evolve seperately, but for simplicity's
    sake we'll use one <code>git</code> repo.
